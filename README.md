# CleanArchitecture Android Dictionary App

The Android Dictionary App is a versatile mobile application designed for users to search and explore definitions of words.
The app employs modern Android development practices, incorporating **Room** for local data caching, **Retrofit** for network requests, **Compose** for UI, and **Hilt** for dependency injection.

## Key Features:

1. **Word Definition Search:**
   - Users can easily search for the definitions of words through a user-friendly interface.

2. **Network Calls with Retrofit:**
   - The app utilizes Retrofit to make efficient network calls to a predefined API, fetching the most up-to-date word definitions from an online source.

3. **Local Data Caching with Room:**
   - Room, the local persistence library, is employed to cache word definitions locally. This ensures that users can access previously searched words even when offline, providing a seamless and consistent experience.

4. **Clean Architecture:**
   - The app is structured with a clean architecture approach, promoting code maintainability and scalability. It separates concerns into layers such as presentation, domain, and data.

5. **Hilt for Dependency Injection:**
   - Hilt is used for dependency injection, simplifying the management of dependencies within the app. This contributes to a modular and testable codebase.

6. **Compose for Dynamic UI:**
   - Jetpack Compose is employed to create a dynamic and responsive user interface. The UI adapts to different screen sizes and orientations, enhancing the overall user experience.

7. **Offline Mode:**
   - In the absence of an internet connection, the app seamlessly switches to offline mode, retrieving word definitions from the local database. This ensures users have access to previously searched words even in offline scenarios.

8. **User-Friendly Interface:**
   - The app features an intuitive and aesthetically pleasing interface, making word searches and exploration a user-friendly experience.

The Android Dictionary App combines the power of Room, Retrofit, Compose, and Hilt to deliver a robust and efficient dictionary experience. With its emphasis on offline functionality through local data caching, users can access word definitions regardless of their internet connectivity, making it a reliable and versatile tool for language enthusiasts.
